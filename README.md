# Stock Market Data Fetcher

This project is a simple Python script that fetches stock market data from the Alpha Vantage API. 

It fetches the closing price for the most recent trading day for specified stocks;

### By default, the script fetches data for the stocks “PBR”, “VALE” and "BBD". You can replace these with any other stock you’re interested in.

#### Remember to create a .env file and add your API to **MY_API_KEY**
